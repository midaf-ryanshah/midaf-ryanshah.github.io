## Supporting Developers Through Turbulent Times  
At Mid AF Technologies, we were founded in 2024 during a period of widespread lay-offs within the games industry. We saw countless talented individuals caught in transitions between roles, often left uncertain about their next steps. 

Our mission is to provide a safe haven for developers in such situations—offering meaningful, temporary roles that allow them to stay active in their careers, earn a paycheck, and continue contributing to incredible projects.

Our structure is designed to be flexible. Developers who join us between jobs can come and go as their career needs evolve. Whether it’s a few weeks, several months, or longer, we tailor opportunities to suit each individual. For us, it’s about being in the right place at the right time—ensuring no talent is left behind.

## Not Looking for Temporary Work? We Still Want You  
While many of our roles cater to developers between jobs, we’re always on the lookout for individuals who want to become a more permanent part of our team. Talent and passion don’t have an expiration date, and you might be exactly who we need—even if you’re not seeking something temporary.

If you’re eager to join a forward-thinking studio that prioritizes bold, innovative game development, don’t hesitate to apply. Whether you’re transitioning between roles or looking for a new, long-term opportunity, Mid AF Technologies offers a collaborative and creative environment where great ideas thrive.

At Mid AF Technologies, we primarily work in Unreal Engine, and we value candidates who are comfortable using this powerful tool. However, technical expertise is only part of the picture. Here’s what we prioritize in our team members:
 
- **Passion:** You hear this on most career pages, but at Mid AF, we really mean it. We are here because we're obsessed with video-games and our ideal candidate echos the sentiment. If you live video-games, love puzzle solving and want to create something unique - you're are our ideal candidate.
- **Puzzle Solvers:** You don’t need to know everything, but you should be ready to dive in.

If you’re resourceful, adaptable, and thrive in uncharted territory, you’re exactly who we’re looking for.
- **Detail-Oriented Creators:** It’s the small details that elevate a game from good to unforgettable. We’re looking for people who care deeply about the craft and aren’t satisfied and take pride in the smallest details of their craft.
- **Unreal Engine Enthusiasts:** We work primarily in Unreal Engine, and while you don’t need to be an expert, a solid foundation and a hunger to learn are key. If you’re passionate about mastering this tool and using it to push boundaries, we want you on our team.
