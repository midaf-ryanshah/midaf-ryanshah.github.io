Mid AF Technologies is a bold and innovative video game studio founded in 2024 in the United Kingdom. Born amidst a period of historic lay-offs in the games industry, we set out with a clear mission: to create a space where developers can thrive, regardless of their circumstances, while working on games that only Mid AF can deliver.  

At Mid AF, we embrace the audacity of our name. “Mid AF” might raise eyebrows, but for us, it’s a statement of defiance—a rejection of mediocrity and a commitment to delivering games that push boundaries and challenge expectations. We’re not here to follow the industry’s trends; we’re here to rewrite the rules.

## Why We Exist  
The games industry is full of challenges, but we thrive in the chaos. Mid AF Technologies was founded to meet those challenges head-on, building not just games, but a philosophy of innovation and resilience. Our goal is to create experiences that resonate, surprise, and endure—projects that could only come from Mid AF.  

We don’t hire just anybody. At Mid AF, it’s not about where you’ve been or what you believe—it’s about what you can do. We value people who are driven, talented, and ready to take on the challenges of building bold, unforgettable games. If you have the skills and the mindset to think differently, there’s a place for you here.

## Our Vision  
At Mid AF Technologies, we believe that great games don’t just happen—they’re built by people unafraid to take risks and challenge conventions. Our vision is to craft experiences that stand apart, games that players remember long after they’ve put down the controller.  

We primarily work with Unreal Engine, leveraging its capabilities to create innovative systems, immersive worlds, and mechanics that defy expectations. Every project here is designed to push the boundaries of what’s possible, driven by a team united in their passion for games and puzzle-solving.

## Our Culture  
At Mid AF, creativity isn’t just encouraged—it’s essential. We’re not interested in fitting into the industry’s molds or following the latest trends. Instead, we cultivate an environment where individuals from all walks of life can contribute their unique perspectives to something greater.  

This isn’t about diversity for diversity’s sake—it’s about assembling a team with the drive and skills to create what no one else can. We respect individuality, welcome differing views, and prioritize results over personalities. What matters to us is what you bring to the table and how it helps us achieve our shared goal: making games that are unapologetically Mid AF.

## The Mid AF Difference  
Mid AF Technologies isn’t just another studio. We’re building games that only we can build, with a team that isn’t afraid to take risks and break conventions. Every idea we explore, every decision we make, and every game we deliver is a reflection of our belief that “Mid AF” is just the beginning.
